                            Designed and developed software for the maintenance division of Aurify Constructions to assist in the management,
                            tracking, and fulfillment of work orders requested from multiple clients.

                            As the sole developer behind the company's web application, I took on a central role in transforming initial
                            requirements into a robust and user-friendly software solution. From gathering basic requirements to proposing
                            the development to company directors, I spearheaded every stage of the project's lifecycle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Initially, I employed waterfall methodologies to meticulously address the initial requirements,
                            ensuring a seamless transition for the company to the new software platform. Subsequently,
                            I transitioned to spiral methodologies to iteratively implement new features and enhancements,
                            continuously adapting to evolving user needs and feedback.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the development journey, I remained committed to continuous learning and improvement,
                            leveraging version control systems such as GitHub to manage code changes and streamline the development process.
                            Implementing frequent refactoring efforts, including migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript and crafting
                            a cohesive set of components for consistent application design, significantly enhanced maintainability,
                            performance, and user experience.

                        <p>
                            I proactively refined the software based on evolving user needs, incorporating features such as Outlook 
                            (VSTO) add-ins and additional application functionalities to boost productivity and efficiency. 
                            Additionally, I developed comprehensive guides and tutorials for the operation of the software, 
                            ensuring a smooth transition and empowering users to leverage the full capabilities of the application.

                            As an honours student in 2022, I had the privilege of conducting research under the supervision of 
                            Professor Paul Kennedy and Associate Professor Daniel Catchpoole, focusing on the development of a 
                            neural network for the classification of Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare childhood tumor, based on histological
                            features. Titled "Explaining How Deep Learning Models Classify Childhood Tumours Based on Histological Features," 
                            my thesis aimed to bridge the gap between medical diagnosis and artificial intelligence, 
                            with the ultimate goal of influencing treatment plans and identifying subgroups within this complex disease.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the project, I meticulously worked towards several key objectives. This included collecting and 
                            pre-processing rhabdomyosarcoma datasets to ensure data quality and consistency, building and validating a 
                            neural network capable of classifying the tumor into major histological groups with accuracy comparable to 
                            pathologists, and extending the model's capabilities to detect anomalies and locate new patterns.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Collaborating closely with my supervisors, histopathologists, and fellow students, I engaged in weekly meetings to discuss 
                            progress, share insights, and refine methodologies. Leveraging cutting-edge techniques in deep learning, 
                            I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify histological samples into subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma, 
                            while also exploring Explainable AI methods to interpret the model's decisions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The culmination of my research efforts was reflected in the successful completion of my thesis, which achieved
                            a grade of 92%. Additionally, I had the opportunity to present my findings at a Children's Cancer Research Unit 
                            seminar, where I effectively communicated complex computer science concepts to a multidisciplinary audience of 
                            biologists, showcasing my ability to bridge the gap between diverse fields of study.
